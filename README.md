ryptography Library (cipherlib)

## What is it?
Created in Java this library gives the creator premade classes for a variety of cryptographic algorithms ranging in complexity and security.

## What's included?
* Source code for each cryptographic algorithm.
* Example programs demonstrating how the implement each algorithm.
* Output files of all classes.
* JAR file of the library.
